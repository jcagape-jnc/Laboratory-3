The easiest design for me was the profile banner because I already had a clear idea of how I wanted to present myself and my brand.
Having a logo, color palette, and tagline helped me feel more confident when starting the design process.
I applied consistent branding by using the same colors, typography, and visual style across all three outputs so they felt connected.
I paid close attention to readability by keeping the text short, using strong headlines, and arranging elements in a way that guides the viewer’s eyes naturally.
Creating the square post and promotional image challenged me to balance creativity with clarity, especially when adding humor and advocacy without overcrowding the design. 
Through this activity, I learned that effective social media graphics don’t need to be complicated—clarity, consistency, and intention matter more than adding too many elements.
Overall, this task helped me better understand how design choices affect how messages are seen and understood online.
